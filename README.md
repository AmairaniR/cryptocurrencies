# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview 

In this repository a report on cryptocurrencies is created using unspervised maching learning's KMeans algorithm to create a classification system on the different crypocurrience. This classification will then be offered as an investement portfolio for the clients of Accountability Accounting. 

## Summary 

Using the principal components algorith (PCA), the number of features were reduced to three principal component. Then an elbow curve graph was created using hvplot to find the best value for K, which was determined to be four. A KMeans model was then initialized so predictions could be made on the cryptocurrency data. These predictions were then visualized in a number of plots using hvplot (i.e. table, 2D scatter plot, 3d scatter plot).
